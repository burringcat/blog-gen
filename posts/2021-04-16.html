Use Websocket to Connect to a Weechat Relay

<h2>The Weechat Relay</h2>
As is said in the <a href='https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay_plugin'>weechat doc</a>, the weechat relay is a relay that can relay weechat data. Now they support the WebSocket for all relay protocols, so we can use <a href='https://www.nginx.com'>nginx</a> to reverse proxy the data.
<h2>Setup a Weechat Relay</h2>
<h3>Open Weechat</h3>
Start a weechat relay, with the <b>weechat</b> protocol, and make it listen to port 9000, and now it can be connected using websocket.

<b>/relay add weechat 9000</b>

As we can see, <b>weechat</b> is the relay's <b>name</b> and <b>protocol</b>, and you can delete the relay by running <b>/relay del weechat</b>.

<h3>Setup NGINX</h3>
I usually have <b>weechat</b> running in a <b>tmux</b> buffer (or session?). Now we need to setup the reverse proxy in order to expose the <b>weechat relay</b> safely to the internet. Here is how I did it.

Now assume we have a <b>debian</b> server and <b>weechat.example.com</b> is resolved to the server's public IP address(has an <b>A</b> record!).

Install nginx, certbot and the nginx plugin for certbot.

<b>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx certbot python-certbot-nginx
</b>

Now create a configuration file for nginx (assuming you are <b>root</b>):

<b>
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
touch weechat.example.com.conf
ln -svf $PWD/weechat.example.com.conf ../sites-enabled
</b>
Now edit <b>weechat.example.com.conf</b>. Here is an example (without SSL!):

<b>
server {
	server_name weechat.example.com;

	listen 80;
	location / {
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	}
}
</b>

Now run <b>nginx -t</b> to make sure there aren't any syntax errors and <b>nginx -s reload</b> to tell nginx to reload.

Run <b>certbot</b> to generate the certificates for SSL and help us finish the setup (it'll edit your <b>weechat.example.com.conf</b> and reload nginx for you!).

<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>
<h3>403 Forbidden</h3>
If you don't know what the variable <b>relay.network.websocket_allowed_origins</b> means, set it to <b>"*"</b> or <b>""</b> to allow you to access the WebSocket interface.
