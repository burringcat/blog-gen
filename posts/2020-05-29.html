Auto compile brotli module for nginx on Debian
<b>The brotli module</b>
The brotli module is included in <b>"nginx plus"</b> but you still need to manually compile it if you are using the free edition. And I have a script for that, you can run it after you install the <b>nginx</b> package.

It assumes you have <b>sudo</b> privilege. See the code <a href="./compile-nginx-br.txt">here</a>.

The script will check the version of current installed nginx and the nginx when the brotli module was last compiled and download the source code for <b>nginx</b> and <b>brotli</b>, and it uses <b>make</b> to compile the code to brotli module's so(Shared Object) files. After that it copies <b>ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so</b> and <b>ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so</b> to <b>/etc/nginx/modules</b>.

To inform nginx to use the brotli module, add these 2 lines at the beginning of your <b>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</b>
<b>load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so;</b>
<b>load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so;</b>

And you can turn on brotli by adding <b>brotli on;</b> and <b>brotli_static on;</b> in a <b>server</b> block. And you can set on which mime types you want to enable brotli compression like below.

<b>brotli_types text/plain text/css text/javascript application/javascript text/xml application/xml image/svg+xml application/json font/ttf text/html image/png application/octet-stream; </b>

Note that you can compress videos too, but seeking won't work on those videos.

<b>Automating the process</b>

The compiled module files are only compatible with the correspond version of nginx, so in case the nginx package gets updated, you need to compile them again.

We can automate the compiling process by adding a dpkg hook.

I have the compile script at <b>/root/.local/bin/compile-nginx-br.sh</b>, and it has the permisson to execute(<b>chmod +x /root/.local/bin/compile-nginx-br.sh</b>), and owned by apt(<b>chown apt /root/.local/bin/compile-nginx-br.sh</b>).

Edit <b>/etc/apt/apt.conf</b> file, and add a post-invoke hook.
<b>DPkg::Post-Invoke {"/root/.local/bin/compile-nginx-br.sh";};</b>
And you are probably done. Since the script will check the current nginx version, you don't need to worry about it being run too many times.
