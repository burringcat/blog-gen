Add One-Time Password to Linux Login
<h2>PAM</h2>
Linux uses PAM for user authentication, so look at <b>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</b>, and you'll see the default unix password authentication library <b>pam_unix.so</b>.

To chain authentication libraries, set the last library to <b>sufficient</b> and all others to <b>required</b>.

Before we change the configuration, be sure to keep an active session, b/c you won't be able to login if you make some mistake.

<h2>Google Authenticatior PAM Library</h2>
On debian, install it with

<b>sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator -y</b>

And add this:

<b>auth sufficient pam_google_authenticator.so</b>

in <b>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</b> after <b>pam_unix.so</b>, and change the necessity of <b>pam_unix.so</b> to <b>required</b>.

The config will look like this:
<b>
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth

auth required pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth sufficient pam_google_authenticator.so
...
</b>

Finally, run <b>google-authenticator</b> to generate a TOTP token url, and you can use any authenticator app or program for it(I recommend <a href="https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp">pass-otp</a>).

Try to login again(you can do a login with <b>ssh username\@localhost</b>), it should ask for an OTP after the password.
