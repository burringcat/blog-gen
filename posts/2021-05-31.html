How to Use blog-gen to Create Your Own Blog

First, you need to clone my repository on github:

<b>git clone https://github.com/thekonungr/blog-gen.git</b>

Then you may want to delete my posts:

<b>rm posts/\*</b>

So, today is May 31st, 2021. Create a file in the <b>posts</b> directory and call it <b>2021-05-31.html</b>. Then you can write some stuff in it. Just remember the first line of <b>2021-05-31.html</b> will be treated as part of the post's title, which would be <b>2021-05-31\|the_first_line</b>.

<h2>The Post File</h2>
You can use any html tag here as you wish, but do remember to escape some special characters so <b>sed</b> and <b>perl</b> won't complain about the regex stuff.

Additionally, use the <b>b</b> tag when you are putting some code in your post.

<h2>Generate the Pages</h2>
Use <b>./gen.sh</b> to generate the index page and all your post pages, and those pages will be at the <b>output</b> directory, where you can use any http server like nginx to serve them.

<h2>About serving</h2>
There is a built-in http server in python. You can run <b>python3 -m http.server</b> to serve the current directory at port 8000.
