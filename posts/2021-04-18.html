I'm Reading The C Programming Language

Hello, now I'm reading the book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DYE10TDVSZIK&dchild=1&keywords=the+c+programming+language&qid=1618724096&sprefix=the+c+programming+language%2Caps%2C420&sr=8-1'>The C Programming Language</a>

I'm also putting some spells I wrote (C code snippets) for my fellow sorcerers on <a href='https://github.com/aleisterw/c_notes'>github</a>.
