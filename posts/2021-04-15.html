Register a New OFTC IRC Account and Setup CertFP With Weechat

<h2>SASL(Simple Authentication and Security Layer)</h2>
Normally, you will need your nickname and password in order to login to an irc server. This time, however, I'll tell you how to login with a client certificate.

<h2>Generating Your Certificate</h2>
Here,

<b>openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 109600 -nodes -out irc.pem -keyout irc.pem</b>

This command will put the private key and your certificate to `irc.pem`.

Use the following command to check when your certificate expires (It will expire in 109600 days or rather 300 years):

<b>openssl x509 -in irc.pem -noout -enddate</b>

Put your certificate in `~/.weechat`(or to the environment variable ${WEECHAT_HOME})

<b>mkdir -p ~/.weechat/certs</b>
<b>mv irc.pem ~/.weechat/certs</b>

<h2>Register at OFTC</h2>
Open weechat and add the OFTC server:

<b>/server add oftc irc.oftc.net/6697 -ssl</b>

Then we do some basic settings:

<b>
/set irc.server.oftc.nicks "mynick,mynick2,mynick3,mynick4,mynick5"

/set irc.server.oftc.username "My user name"

/set irc.server.oftc.realname "My real name"

/set irc.server.oftc.autoconnect on

/set irc.server.oftc.ssl on

/set irc.server.oftc.ssl_cert %h/certs/irc.pem

/set irc.server.oftc.sasl_mechanism external
</b>
Then we connect to the server:
<b>/connect oftc</b>
Then tell NickServ to register your nickname:
<b>/msg NickServ REGISTER YourPassword youremail@example.com</b>
Then go to <a href='https://services.oftc.net'>services.oftc.net</a> to login with your nickname and password and <a href='https://services.oftc.net/account/verify'>verify your account</a>.

Don't forget to tell <b>NickServ</b> to check your verification status:

<b>/msg NickServ checkverify</b>

<h2>Add the Certificate to Your Account</h2>

<b>/msg NickServ CERT ADD</b>

Disconnect and connect again, now you are using your certificate for authentication (as an external mechanism for SASL)!
